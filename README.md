Spam is unsolicited and unwanted messages sent electronically and whose content may be malicious. Email spam is sent/received over the Internet while SMS spam is typically transmitted over a mobile network. We’ll refer to user that sent spam as ‘spammers’. SMS messages are usually very cheap (if not free) for the user to send, making it appealing for unrightful exploitation. This is further aggravated by the fact that SMS is usually regarded by the user as a safer, more trustworthy form of communication than other sources, e. g., emails.

The dangers of spam messages for the users are many: undesired advertisement, exposure of private information, becoming a victim of a fraud or financial scheme, being lured into malware and phishing websites, involuntary exposition to inappropriate content, etc. For the network operator, spam messages result in an increased cost in operations.
Using this Spam Sms Classifier you can detect a message is Spam or not easily
